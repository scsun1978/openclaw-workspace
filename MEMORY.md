## Notion Memory Rules

- Bot-specific memory (this bot / this host context) should be recorded at:
  - https://www.notion.so/cloudservice/openclaw-bot-in-macbook-30570574a74f80ceb08afde345709dfb
- Shared memory (for coordination with other bots) should be recorded at:
  - https://www.notion.so/cloudservice/openclaw-shared-memory-30570574a74f8085b788f4976e386794

## Usage Rule

- If content is specific to this bot instance, machine, or local runtime behavior, store it in the **bot-specific** page.
- If content needs to be visible/usable by multiple bots, store it in the **shared memory** page.
