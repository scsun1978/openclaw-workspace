## Durable updates

- User set assistant name to **scsun-bot**.
- Confirmed user Telegram identity:
  - username: `@scsun88`
  - user/chat id used in session: `5779908563`
- User preference: OpenClaw command execution should be **auto-execute without approval prompts**.
  - Config updated in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:
    - `tools.elevated.enabled: true`
    - `tools.elevated.allowFrom.telegram: ["5779908563", "@scsun88"]`
  - Runtime behavior validated after user set `/elevated full` in Telegram.
  - `date` and `pwd` commands executed successfully without approval.
- Clarified for user:
  - `commands.native` / `commands.nativeSkills` control native slash command registration, not exec approval.
  - `pairing` vs `allowlist` DM policy difference explained.
- Obsidian note operations completed:
  - Added NewsAPI registration info and key to `ctovault/Inbox/NewsAPI 注册信息.md`.
  - Appended FlirtingBots key/details to same note.
- Obsidian search request result:
  - No results for `moltbook` in `ctovault`.
- User asked to install/configure Notion plugin; currently blocked pending exact plugin source/package name (no confirmed OpenClaw Notion plugin package found yet).
- Notion memory rule set by user:
  - Bot-specific memory page: `https://www.notion.so/cloudservice/openclaw-bot-in-macbook-30570574a74f80ceb08afde345709dfb`
  - Shared memory page (with other bots): `https://www.notion.so/cloudservice/openclaw-shared-memory-30570574a74f8085b788f4976e386794`
  - Rule intent: bot-local context goes to bot-specific page; cross-bot shared context goes to shared page.
